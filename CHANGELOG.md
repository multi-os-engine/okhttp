    adapter. (thanks kwuollett)
 *  Add a media type class to OkHttp.
 *  Change custom header prefix:

    ```
    X-Android-Sent-Millis is now OkHttp-Sent-Millis
    X-Android-Received-Millis is now OkHttp-Received-Millis
    X-Android-Response-Source is now OkHttp-Response-Source
    X-Android-Selected-Transport is now OkHttp-Selected-Transport
    ```

 * Fix: Ignore null header values (for compatibility with HttpURLConnection).
 * Add URLStreamHandlerFactory support so that `URL.openConnection()` uses
   OkHttp.
 * Expose the transport ("http/1.1", "spdy/3", etc.) via magic request headers.

   `X-Android-Selected-Transport` to read the negotiated transport.
